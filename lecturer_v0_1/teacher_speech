Hello students!!!
I am here to have a lecture on "Maths and AI".
My name is Dr.Olivia Winston, from Harvard University.

So Greetings everyone arrived here. Let's have a small introduction on AI.
Guess most of you would know about AI - Artificial Intelligence.
AI refers to systems or machines that mimic human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on the information they collect.
